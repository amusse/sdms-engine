@interface BP5 : BP7

/**
 * Establish measurement connection and start BP measurement（Only for BP5）.
 * @param userID  The only identification for the user，by the form of email or cell phone #(cell-phone-# form is not supported temperately).
 * @param clientID  See param 'clientsecret'.
 * @param clientsecret  ‘clientID’ and ‘clientsecret’ are the only identification for user of SDK, are required registration from iHealth administrator, please email: lvjincan@ihealthlabs.com.cn.com for more information.
 * @param disposeAuthenticationBlock   A block to return parameter of ‘userid’, ’clientID’, ’clientSecret’ after the verification.
 * The interpretation for the verification:
 *  1. UserAuthen_RegisterSuccess, New-user registration succeeded.
 *  2. UserAuthen_LoginSuccess， User login succeeded.
 *  3. UserAuthen_CombinedSuccess, The user is iHealth user as well, measurement via SDK has been activated, and the data from the measurement belongs to the user.
 *  4. UserAuthen_TrySuccess, testing without Internet connection succeeded.
 *  5. UserAuthen_InvalidateUserInfo, Userid/clientID/clientSecret verification failed.
 *  6. UserAuthen_SDKInvalidateRight, SDK has not been authorized.
 *  7. UserAuthen_UserInvalidateRight,User has not been authorized.
 *  8. UserAuthen_InternetError, Internet error, verification failed.
 *  --PS:
 *  The measurement via SDK will be operated in the case of 1-4, and will be terminated if any of 5-8 occurs. The interface needs to be re-called after analyzing the return parameters.
 *  @Notice   By the first time of new user register via SDK, ‘iHealth disclaimer’ will pop up automatically, and require the user agrees to continue. SDK application requires Internet connection; there is 10-day tryout if SDK cannot connect Internet, SDK is fully functional during tryout period, but will be terminated without verification through Internet after 10 days.
 * @param pressure  Pressure value in the process of measurement, the unit is ‘mmHg’.
 * @param xiaobo  Wavelet data set including pulse rate
 * @param xiaoboNoHeart’: Wavelet data set without pulse rate
 * @param result   result of the measurement, including systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, pulse rate and irregular judgment. Relevant key: time, sys, dia, heartRate, irregular
 * @param error   Return error codes.
 * Specification:
 *   1.  BPError0 = 0: Unable to take measurements due to arm/wrist movements.
 *   2.  BPError1:  Failed to detect systolic pressure.
 *   3.  BPError2:  Failed to detect diastolic pressure.
 *   4.  BPError3:  Pneumatic system blocked or cuff is too tight during inflation.
 *   5.  BPError4:  Pneumatic system leakage or cuff is too loose during inflation.
 *   6.  BPError5:  Cuff pressure reached over 300mmHg.
 *   7.  BPError6:  Cuff pressure reached over 15 mmHg for more than 160 seconds.
 *   8.  BPError7:  Data retrieving error.
 *   9.  BPError8:  Data retrieving error.
 *   10.  BPError9:  Data retrieving error.
 *   11.  BPError10:  Data retrieving error.
 *   12.  BPError11:  Communication Error.
 *   13.  BPError12:  Communication Error.
 *   14.  BPError13:  Low battery.
 *   15.  BPError14:  Device bluetooth set failed.
 *   16.  BPError15:  Systolic exceeds 260mmHg or diastolic exceeds 199mmHg.
 *   17.  BPError16:  Systolic below 60mmHg or diastolic below 40mmHg.
 *   18.  BPError17:  Arm/wrist movement beyond range.
 *   19.  BPNormalError=30:  device error, error message displayed automatically.
 *   20.  BPOverTimeError:  Abnormal communication.
 *   21.  BPNoRespondError:  Abnormal communication.
 *   22.  BPBeyondRangeError:  device is out of communication range.
 *   23.  BPDidDisconnect:  device is disconnected.
 *   24.  BPAskToStopMeasure:  measurement has been stopped.
 *   25.  BPInputParameterError=400:  Parameter input error.
